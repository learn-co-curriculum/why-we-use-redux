# Why Redux 

In the previous sections we spent a while discussing the how of redux.  Through each step, we tried to explain the various steps that got you there, and you likely went on nodding your head and agreeing the entire way.  

After implementing a project with redux, you may have noticed that the redux world is complicated.  And as you move onto projects in the future, you should ask yourself if it's worth it.  Here, we'll show you some resources for asking just those questions.

### When to use redux

First, let's look at what the creator of redux, Dan Abramov, tells us.  In the article, he highlights a common theme in programming, which is that abstraction often has a cost of indirection.

Can the points that he brings out about redux, also explain moving from SQL to ActiveRecord, or Ruby/Sinatra to Rails?  If not, what's the difference?

### This is why we redux

Still, we asked you to learn redux.  Here's some arguments as to why.

It's a good idea to re-read some of the redux documentation now that you have some experience, to see the purposed of redux, and to gather how well redux lives up to that purpose.

This article talks about how redux helps a react application - the main conclusion "Single Source of Truth":

Think about other times you have heard us say that phrase.  How does single source of truth compare with redux as opposed to in databases.  Are the benefits still valid?  Where are they not valid?

And redux as a way to enforce thinking:
